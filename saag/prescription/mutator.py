"""
saag/prescription/mutator.py

Applies a compiled policy Delta(G) to the flat JSON topology export.

Pure: takes JSON in, returns new JSON out. No repository, no simulation. The
mutation is done on the export rather than in the database so a candidate can be
evaluated without contaminating the target store or paying transaction overhead.
