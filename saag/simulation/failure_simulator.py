Failure Simulator

Simulates component failures and their cascading effects on the system.
Works directly on RAW structural relationships without DEPENDS_ON derivation.

Impact Metrics:
    - Reachability Loss: Percentage of broken pub-sub paths (broker-aware)
    - Infrastructure Fragmentation: Graph connectivity loss (connected components)
    - Throughput Loss: QoS-weighted reduction in message delivery capacity
    - Cascade Count: Number of components affected by cascade

Cascade Rules:
    - Physical: Node failure -> hosted components fail (RUNS_ON)
    - Logical: Broker failure -> topics become unreachable;
               Publisher failure -> subscriber starvation
    - Network: Network partition via CONNECTS_TO
    - Library: Library failure -> using applications fail (USES)
