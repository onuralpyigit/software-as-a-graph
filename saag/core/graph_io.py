"""
saag/core/graph_io.py — build a NetworkX graph from a topology JSON
===================================================================

Both loaders below used to live in ``cli/`` as underscore-private helpers, and
fifteen modules under ``reproduce/`` imported them by those private names
(``from cli.loso_evaluate import _build_graph_from_json``). That inverted the
dependency the architecture describes: the replication package reached into the
presentation layer for a core primitive, and a rename in a CLI script would have
broken the paper's reproduction with no test to catch it.

They are kept as **two** functions rather than merged. They produce the same
nodes and edges but not the same node attributes -- fingerprinting both over
``atm_system``, ``av_system`` and ``realworld_edgex`` gives identical
node/edge counts and different attribute hashes -- so collapsing them would
silently change what every downstream artifact was computed from. Which one a
caller wants is a real choice:

* :func:`build_graph_from_json` takes a parsed topology dict. This is the one the
  evaluation harnesses use.
* :func:`load_graph` takes a path and additionally handles the per-entity
  ``type`` field carried by the five real-world topologies, which collides with
  the ``type=`` keyword the other builder passes.

``cli/loso_evaluate.py`` and ``cli/simulate_graph.py`` re-export these under
their original private names, so existing imports keep working.
