## 3. Candidate novelty claims (to be defended)

1. **Placement as a graph edit on the structural graph.** Moving an application changes a
   `RUNS_ON` edge. Re-deriving `DEPENDS_ON` (the six rules,
   [docs/graph-model.md](../../graph-model.md)) changes the failure-impact landscape. In
   C1, C2, C3 and C5 (all verified from the full text) the dependency or interaction model is
   fixed input, not a function of the placement. The same appears true of C4 and F1–F4, but
   only from their abstracts.
2. **The objective is cascade impact on the derived graph, not a per-service reliability
   formula.** C4 and A3 use analytic reliability models. F3 and F4 use path- or
   k-out-of-n-based reliability.
3. **Verify before recommending.** A candidate placement is accepted only if its reduction
   in counterfactual impact exceeds κ·σ_seed at every propagation threshold, reusing
   [EditVerifier](../../../saag/prescription/verifier.py). No row above has this acceptance
   criterion.
4. **Co-location vs isolation as an empirical question, not an assumption.** E1 (co-location
   helps) and K1 (spreading helps) disagree. Characterising *when* each wins on pub-sub
   graphs is a finding in its own right.

**C1 (CHASE) full-text verdict, 2026-10-08:**

- **Claim 1 survives.** CHASE's sponsoring and synchronization dependencies are fixed tenant
  input in a UML model. Placement never creates or removes a dependency. Co-location only
  changes which *infrastructure failure scope* two components share.
- **Claim 2 survives.** Criticality is one hop and analytic: per component `MTTF × MTTR`, and
  for a sponsor SC with dependents DeC, `Degradation = MTTF_SC × OT_DeC` and
  `Outage = MTTF_SC × (OT_DeC − MTTR_SC)`, weighted by the redundancy model. Nothing
  propagates past a direct dependent.
- **Claim 3 survives.** The evaluation computes downtime from the same MTTF/MTTR quantities
  the scheduler optimizes. There is no fault injection and no independent oracle, so the
  objective and the evaluation measure are the same thing. Name this explicitly in the paper,
  because it is the circularity we must avoid ourselves.
- **Claim 4 must engage CHASE directly.** CHASE already gives a *pairwise rule* for
  co-location vs isolation: **co-locate** a dependent with its sponsor when the dependent
  cannot tolerate the sponsor's recovery time (outage tolerance < recovery time); otherwise
  **anti-locate**, and always anti-locate redundant replicas. Our claim must be that this
  pairwise rule is wrong or insufficient on **transitive** pub-sub chains, where co-locating
  A with B also exposes everything downstream of B. That has to be shown, not asserted.
- **CHASE is also a direct baseline** (see §4). Its rule needs a per-dependent tolerance time
  and a per-sponsor recovery time. `Topic.deadline_ms` is a possible tolerance analogue. The
  only recovery time we have is the single global `mean_recovery_time` in the event
  simulator's config ([saag/simulation/models.py](../../../saag/simulation/models.py)), not
  a per-component attribute.

**C2 (Deploy-PS) full-text verdict, 2026-10-08:**

- **Claims 1–3 survive cleanly.** Pub/sub relations are compiled once into a static set of
  communicating pairs. There is no failure model of any kind and no independent evaluation:
  the "generated vs manual" comparison is scored by the tool's own cost evaluator.
- **C2 is the cost pole of claim 4, and that makes it useful.** Its objective makes
  communication cost **zero for co-located pairs** and has no failure term, so on its own it
  pushes communicating participants together. That is exactly the co-location bias whose
  failure-side price we want to measure. Framing: *Deploy-PS (and CTAP in general) is the
  cost-only end of our Pareto front; we add the failure-impact axis it lacks.*
- **Prior-work proximity.** Deploy-PS and its predecessors (S-IDE in JSS 2013, TOMACS 2013,
  Deploy-DDS at ECSA-W 2014) are Turkish/Dutch software-architecture work on pub-sub/DDS
  deployment, which overlaps your own community and target venues. Expect these authors, or
  their readers, as reviewers. Cite the whole line, not just the 2017 paper.
- **Weaknesses we can contrast with, carefully and factually:** a single 4-node case study
  against one manual baseline; no repetitions; CPU power named but not modelled; solver
  unspecified in the method section; and the deployment-alternative counts in Table 2
  (8334 / 11112 / 13890 for 1390 participants on 6 / 8 / 10 nodes) are close to
  participants × nodes, not nodes^participants. The counting function (their Fig. 3) did not
  survive text extraction, so check the figure before raising that point.

**C5 (DIF) full-text verdict, 2026-10-08:**

- **This is the strongest software-engineering precedent, and it is a TSE paper.** It already
  does placement of components onto hosts for **availability** (among other QoS dimensions),
  with exact (MIP), greedy and genetic solvers, constraints that force or forbid sharing a
  host, and **two real application families that were actually deployed**. Any claim that
  "deployment optimization for availability" is new is dead on arrival.
- **Claims 1–3 still survive.** Interactions are fixed input. Availability is the fraction
  of successful interactions given **network-link reliability**; host failures are not
  modelled and nothing propagates along interactions. The utility being optimized is also
  the evaluation measure; there is no independent check.
- **The real threat is DIF's extensibility.** DIF says any QoS dimension that can be
  quantitatively estimated can be plugged in, and its related work names stochastic
  reliability models as possible plug-ins. A reviewer can argue *"cascade impact is just
  another qValue function inside DIF."* The answer has to be that the contribution is
  **what the objective measures and what we find with it**: a dependency graph derived per
  placement, correlated host failure, transitive cascades, verification against seed noise,
  and the co-location vs isolation result. A new optimization framework is not the
  contribution. Do not pitch the search machinery as novel.
- **Claim 4 gets sharper.** In DIF's instantiation, failures live on network links, so
  putting interacting components on the same host can only remove failure exposure. Check
  this against the Fig. 5 formula, which is an image. Together with C2 (zero communication
  cost when co-located), that makes two established frameworks whose models structurally
  favour co-location. CHASE (C1) is the only one that pushes back, and only one hop deep.
- **Scope difference to state up front.** DIF handles initial deployment *and* runtime
  redeployment, including redeployment cost. Ours is pre-deployment only, so justify why
  getting the first placement right matters, e.g. safety-critical or embedded systems where
  redeploying at runtime is not allowed.
- **Reuse:** DIF's *unbiased average* (mean utility of 10,000 random valid deployments) is
  a good, citable form of our random-placement floor.

**C3 (ScatterD) full-text verdict, 2026-10-08:** (CrossTalk article only; the ACM TAAS paper
has been seen at abstract level)

- **Claims 1–3 survive cleanly.** No failure model of any kind, communication volumes are
  fixed input, and the only comparison is against the legacy deployment.
- **This is the strongest motivating example for the paper.** On a real Lockheed Martin
  avionics system, the optimizer **consolidated 14 processors into 8 (−42.8%)** and cut
  bandwidth by 24% *by co-locating communicating tasks*, with no account of what now fails
  together. ARINC 653 partitioning isolates software in time and memory but not against the
  processor itself failing. That is exactly the question our method answers: *what did the
  consolidation do to failure impact?* Present it carefully. ScatterD never claimed to address
  reliability, so the point is that the field's industrial success stories leave this
  unmeasured, not that ScatterD was wrong.
- **Claim 4: a third co-location-favouring model.** C2 (zero communication cost when
  co-located), C3 (zero bandwidth when co-located, plus minimize processors) and, pending the
  Fig. 5 check, C5 (link failures only) all push communicating components together. C1 is the
  only counterweight, and only one hop deep.
- **Possible experiment:** a ScatterD-style consolidation (minimize processors, then
  bandwidth) is a natural extra baseline. Run it on the scenario corpus and measure the
  failure impact of the consolidated placements with our simulator. If impact rises
  measurably, that is a headline result; if it doesn't, that is worth knowing early.
- **Solver idea worth borrowing:** searching over *packing orders* rather than raw
  assignments keeps every candidate feasible. It fits a constrained search where each
  candidate must also pass the counterfactual check.

| Baseline | Stands for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes default + topology spread | K1 | Cheapest credible baseline |
| CHASE-style greedy filter pipeline | C1 | Criticality order → capacity → delay → co-/anti-location rule (tolerance vs sponsor recovery time) → max-availability host → anti-located replicas. Needs tolerance and recovery-time inputs |
| Capacitated task allocation (ILP) | C2, E3 | C2's exact objective: Σ a_ip·x_ip + Σ_(i,j)∈E Σ_p a_ip(1−a_jp)·c_ij under memory capacity, with c_ij from topic publication rates. Linearizes to a standard ILP. It is the cost-only anchor of the Pareto front, and it isolates what the failure-impact term adds |
| NSGA-II over allocations | C4, A2, A3, F3 | Same search, analytic reliability objective instead of cascade impact |
| Predecessor co-location heuristic | E1 | The opposite of spreading |
| Consolidation (min processors, then bandwidth) | C3 | ScatterD-style: GA/PSO over packing order + bin-packing with capacity checks. Tests what aggressive consolidation does to failure impact |
| Random feasible placement | C5 | Sanity floor. Report it as C5's *unbiased average*: the mean over many random valid placements, not a single draw |

      constraints; the case study (automotive?), its scale and baselines.
- [ ] Also behind paywalls, and relevant once C4 is read: the same group's QoSA 2010 paper,
      "Architecture-Driven Reliability and Energy Optimization for Complex Embedded Systems"
      (DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-13821-8_6; redundancy allocation in ArcheOpterix, automotive
      case study), and Meedeniya, Aleti & Bühnová, "Redundancy Allocation in Automotive
      Systems using Multi-objective Optimisation" (2009, multi-objective ant colony
      optimization over reliability, cost and response time).
- [ ] Then read the full text of A3, E1, F3, F4. Fill in every `n/v`.
- [ ] Read ScatterD's archival paper (White, Dougherty, Thompson & Schmidt, ACM TAAS 6(3),
      2011). It is the one to cite for the algorithm. Also find the CrossTalk issue and year,
      and the related BLITZ bin-packing paper from the same group (ICSE 2009, on a production
      flight avionics system).
- [ ] Read the C2 predecessors, which are stronger venues than C2 itself:
      Çelik & Tekinerdogan, "S-IDE: A tool framework for optimizing deployment architecture
      of High Level Architecture based simulation systems," JSS 86:2520–2541, 2013;
      Çelik, Tekinerdogan & Imre, "Deriving feasible deployment alternatives for parallel and
      distributed simulation systems," ACM TOMACS 23(3), Art. 18, 2013;
      Celik, Koksal & Tekinerdogan, "Deploy-DDS," ECSA Workshops 2014, Art. 35.
- [x] Add and read DIF (C5). Done 2026-10-08; see §3.
- [ ] Recover DIF's Fig. 5 (the availability, latency, security and energy formulas, an image
      in the PDF). It decides whether co-located interactions count as always successful,
      which is the basis of the claim-4 argument in §3.
- [ ] Read DIF's availability-specific predecessor: Malek, Mikic-Rakic & Medvidovic, "A
      Decentralized Redeployment Algorithm for Improving the Availability of Distributed
      Systems," Component Deployment 2005. Also forward-snowball DIF; it is the most likely
      ancestor of any later deployment-for-availability work in TSE or ICSE.
- [ ] Look up Kang, He & Wei, "An effective iterated greedy algorithm for reliability-oriented
      task allocation in distributed computing systems," JSS 2013 (C2's reference lists the
      volume as 73, which does not match a 2013 JSS volume; verify).
- [ ] Read the CHASE predecessor: Jammal, Kanso & Shami, "High Availability-Aware
      Optimization Digest for Applications Deployment in Cloud," IEEE ICC 2015 (the MILP
      formulation and the UML model).
- [ ] Snowball the availability-aware placement work cited by CHASE. These are likely
      reviewer picks, especially the DSN ones:
      Jung et al., performance- and availability-aware regeneration (DSN 2010);
      Li et al., "Improving Availability of Cloud-Based Applications through Deployment
      Choices" (IEEE CLOUD 2013);
      Lu et al., uncertainty in deployment decisions for availability (IEEE CLOUD 2013);
      Machida et al., redundant VM placement (NOMS 2010);
      Harper et al., DynaPlan (DSN-W 2011);
      Bin et al., "Guaranteeing High Availability Goals for Virtual Machine Placement"
      (ICDCS 2011).
- [ ] Forward-snowball CHASE (who cites it, 2016 onward). Check especially for any follow-up
      that adds transitive dependencies.
- [ ] Check the TSE 2013 volume/issue/pages (A1) and the ArcheOpterix workshop venue (A2).
- [ ] Find the original 2017 FogTorch venue (F1) and E3's year and venue.
- [ ] Run a **structured search** (Scopus / IEEE Xplore / ACM DL) with a recorded
      protocol, so that the gap claims in §3 rest on more than one web pass. Suggested
      terms: `"deployment optimization" AND (reliability OR availability)`,
      `"component allocation" AND "publish-subscribe"`,
      `"correlated failure" AND placement AND dependency`, `"broker placement" AND reliability`.
- [ ] Do backward/forward snowballing from A1, C1 and C4. The A1 survey's 188 papers are the
      SE-side backbone.
- [ ] Check for **DDS- and ROS 2-specific** placement work beyond C2/C3 (for example, the
      transport-selection framework of De Marchi & Bombieri, 2024, and FogROS2-Config).

## 6. What the framework already provides (and lacks)

| Needed | Status in repo |
|---|---|
| `RUNS_ON` structural edges, Node layer | ✓ (`infra` layer, [saag/core/layers.py](../../../saag/core/layers.py)) |
| Re-derivation of `DEPENDS_ON` from raw edges | ✓ [SimulationGraph](../../../saag/simulation/graph.py) |
| Host-split / reallocation operator | ✓ [mutator.py](../../../saag/prescription/mutator.py), [rules.py](../../../saag/prescription/rules.py) (reactive, single edit) |
| Counterfactual acceptance test | ✓ [verifier.py](../../../saag/prescription/verifier.py) |
| Node resource capacities, application resource demands | **✗** `Node` has no attributes ([saag/core/models.py](../../../saag/core/models.py)). Adding them requires a generator change, corpus regeneration and a manifest refresh |
| Constructive (whole-system) placement search | **✗** |
| Oracle independent of the optimization objective | **✗** Needs a decision: real deployment with failure injection, or a held-out oracle |

**Boundary with AuSE:** AuSE verifies *individual edits* to an existing deployment after
the fact. This paper *synthesizes a whole placement* under resource constraints. Both
manuscripts must state this explicitly.
